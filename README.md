Git and python for CentOS 7

If you've reached here, I guess that you need some updated open source tools to your CentOS 7, RedHatâ€™s solution for that is to compile these tools on your own...

So, we did it for you, git and python were compiled in portable mode so you will be easier to upgrade these tools when needed.
